A simple python script for cracking a password-protected zip file. <br>
Utilises a masterlist of passwords and uses pyzipper module for working with AES-encrypted zip files.

cobracodecracker.py -> main program <br>
passwords.txt -> password masterlist (most commonly used passwords in order of usage) <br>
secret4u.zip & test1.zip -> test files <br>
(ensure pyzipper module is installed; `pip install pyzipper`) <br>
